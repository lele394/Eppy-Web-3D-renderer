# Eppy-Web-3D-renderer

Eppy is in a very early stage and currently only supports rendering of 3D triangles using DrawTriangle in a veeeeerry unoptimized way. An example of the current possible implementation is availble in [demo.hmtl](https://github.com/lele394/Eppy-Web-3D-renderer/blob/master/demo.html).

Planned features are :

* using .obj files
* shading of faces
* culling

Eppy currently is extremely inneficient, is heavy on the CPU, and maybe really broken. I plan on porting most of the draw calls to the GPU once the technique works.
Feel free to submit any upgrades you think could be implemented.

Bear in mind that this is just a passion project and is a dumb idea.
